  abstract = {The transportation sector, one of the largest contributors to global energy-related emissions, is undergoing a major transition. Governments worldwide are implementing stringent fuel economy and emissions standards, promoting the adoption of electric vehicles--a key technology for decarbonizing the transport sector--through various policy measures. This dissertation contains four chapters, studying the effects of such policies implemented across major vehicle markets and evaluating their effectiveness, with a particular focus on the electrification of light-duty passenger vehicle fleet.},

abstract = {To accelerate the electrification of the transport sector, many countries subsidize both the construction of public charging infrastructure and the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs). Possible complementarities between these measures raise the question of their optimal calibration. Drawing on county-level panel data from Germany spanning 2014–2021, this paper explores this question with an econometric model of EV uptake. Employing fixed effects- and instrumental variable estimators, we find that charging infrastructure has a positive and significant effect on uptake, one whose magnitude increases with the subsidy level for car purchases. Simulations using the model estimates show how the predicted number of EVs for a given charging capacity level increases with higher consumer subsidies, allowing for a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the optimal expenditure of the two measures.},

  title={Counting vehicle miles traveled: What can we learn from the NHTS?},
  author={Alberini, Anna and Burra, Lavan Teja and Cirillo, Cinzia and Shen, Chang},
  abstract={An accurate estimate of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is an essential input into a variety of emissions, climate change, energy and infrastructure-planning models. We examine different measures of annual miles driven from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), which includes a self-reported and an imputed measure of annual VMT for a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. We compute two additional estimates from the odometer reading, and the trip diary information contained in the NHTS, respectively. We compare these four measures of annual VMT, seek to identify low/high mileage segments of the fleet, and examine the quality of the data and their internal validity. The price elasticity of VMT (−0.275 to −0.20) is comparable across these four measures. Quantile regressions indicate that the households with higher driving intensity are less responsive to the fuel cost per mile. As cars get older, the difference between the four VMT measures tends to increase; this implies large discrepancies in the CO2 emissions that would be saved, for example, when older cars are removed from the fleet, due to natural turnover or when “cash for clunkers” programs are implemented.},

  title={Free-ridership in subsidies for company-and private electric vehicles},
  author={Burra, Lavan T and Sommer, Stephan and Vance, Colin},
  abstract={Consumer subsidies are commonly employed to incentivize the purchase of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), but free-ridership potentially undermines their effectiveness. The present study investigates BEV subsidies in Germany, distinguishing their effect between company- and private cars. Drawing on a panel of high-resolution car registration data, we use the estimates from a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood model to predict BEV registrations in the absence of the subsidy. We calculate aggregate free-rider rates of 56.5% for private cars and 87.1% for company cars. We further find that the cost of the subsidy per induced BEV among private consumers is €9,718, while it is €30,780 among companies. Overall, the estimates suggest that the subsidy is considerably less cost effective among company cars, which comprise 55% of new BEV sales. An auxiliary analysis that recognizes the possibility of differential pass-through rates of the subsidy over time confirms this conclusion.},

  title={Impact of charging infrastructure on electric vehicle adoption: A synthetic population approach},
  author={Burra, Lavan T and Al-Khasawneh, Mohammad B and Cirillo, Cinzia},
  abstract={There is limited availability of travel survey data on households with electric vehicles (EVs) and a lack of evidence on factors influencing EV ownership levels at a finer geographic level, which are crucial for optimizing public charging infrastructure investments. To address this gap, we propose an integrated approach utilizing a discrete choice model and a Bayesian network-generated synthetic population. Applied to Maryland, the model analyzes the impact of public charging stations (level-2 and DC fast chargers) on EV ownership at the census tract level. Access to fast charging, workplace charging, and the possibility of teleworking are key factors influencing EV ownership. The model, applied to the synthetic population, predicts higher EV growth in suburban regions compared to urban areas and a larger increase in EV adoption among high-income groups. This highlights potential disparities in EV adoption and demonstrates the application of this methodology in understanding micro-level EV adoption rates for informing targeted policies and infrastructure development to promote equitable adoption.},

  author={Burra, Lavan T and Shen, Chang and Alberini, Anna and Cirillo, Cinzia},
  abstract={Understanding the driving behavior of multi-car households is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing fuel consumption in the passenger car fleet. In this paper, we investigate whether households adjust their vehicle miles traveled (VMT) among their cars in response to changes in fuel prices. We use data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) on two-car households, where both cars are powered by gasoline, and estimate econometric models that distinguish cars based on their fuel economy. Our results show that an increase in per-mile driving cost significantly reduces the demand for driving the same car and increases demand for driving the other car, with little to no evidence of overall substitution at the daily or annual level. However, further investigation using artificial monthly travel diary data revealed a pronounced substitution towards the most fuel-efficient car only when there is a large and sustained increase in gas price.},

  author={Cirillo, Cinzia and Burra, Lavan T},
  abstract={The problem of modelling car ownership has many facets and has important implications for policy analysis and evaluation in transportation, energy, and environmental science. This area of research has seen growing relevance due to the changes that have happened or that are expected in the automotive marketplace: advanced technology vehicles, electric and hybrid vehicles, autonomous and connected vehicles, and shared mobility. This chapter presents a review of the most relevant and promising approaches proposed to study and forecast vehicle ownership and type, and their use. Methods for modelling vehicle ownership are reviewed with the objective to cover existing knowledge and to identify remaining gaps. It also offers an overview of the most compelling policy questions of our time and provides suggestions for future research.},

  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
