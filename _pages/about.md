**About me** 
I’m an applied research scientist with a Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering and over five years of experience analyzing large-scale behavioral and system data to understand consumer decision-making, forecast demand, and evaluate pricing and incentive impacts. My work spans both energy systems and technology products, with a strong focus on producing actionable insights that inform product strategy, infrastructure planning, and public policy. My technical strengths include:
  - Econometric modeling and causal inference (e.g., DiD, IV, RDD, panel models)
  - Predictive modeling and machine learning for demand forecasting and prediction
  - Behavioral data analysis and discrete choice modeling
  - Data analysis and statistical programming in Python, R, STATA, and SQL
  - Structuring and integrating large-scale, multi-source data: geospatial, survey, time-series, and panel datasets
  - Survey design, sampling, weighting, and bias correction
  - Communicating data-driven insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
  - Cross-functional collaboration with engineering, product, and regulatory teams


<!-- I am interested in multidisciplinary research that spans transportation, energy, and policy domains. My research centers around understanding how consumers and fleet operators adopt and use zero/low-carbon transportation technologies, respond to incentives, and the implications for effective energy and environmental policy. Using econometric techniques and data-driven models, I investigate:  
  &rarr; Electric vehicle market dynamics  
  &rarr; Infrastructure planning and utilization  
  &rarr; Evidence-based policy evaluation
 -->
**Current Position**   
At the [ASPIRE NSF Engineering Research Center](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ASPIRE), I contribute to advancing widespread transportation electrification by modeling EV adoption and utilization patterns, forecasting energy demand, and integrating these insights into power system planning.

**Background**   
I hold a PhD and MS in civil and environmental engineering from the University of Maryland and a bachelor's from IIT Bombay. During my doctoral studies, I also spent a year as a junior applied economist at the [RWI-Leibniz Institute for Economic Research](https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/) in Germany, funded by the Horizon 2020 European Commission fellowship.

<!-- **Areas of Expertise and Interest:**  
  - Data-driven transportation systems modeling
  - Energy and environmental policy
  - Smart and resilient infrastructure systems 
  - Travel demand and behavior modeling
  - Zero/low carbon transportation technologies -->

Lavan is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Aspire Research Center at the Lyles School of Civil Engineering. His research focuses on analyzing consumer purchase decisions for new-vehicle technologies and driving behavior, with an eye towards informing effective design of energy policies. He has a strong interest in multidisciplinary research, particularly regarding how environmental policies and economic incentives influence vehicle choices, travel demand, and other transportation issues.
Lavan received his MS, PhD in civil and environmental engineering from the University of Maryland, and bachelor’s in civil engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. During his doctoral studies, he also spent a year as a researcher at the RWI-Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Germany, funded by a European Commission fellowship.

I'm a recent PhD graduate in Transportation Engineering passionate about using quantitative and statistical analysis to provide evidence-based solutions. I specialize in areas like causal inference, econometric and consumer behavior modeling, predictive modeling, demand forecasting, and policy evaluation.

My work focuses primarily on electric vehicle adoption—investigating the impact of charging infrastructure, shifts in consumer demand for electric cars, and their environmental benefits—often using engineering and econometric techniques. 

I have a keen interest in multidisciplinary research, particularly in addressing questions related to the effects of environmental policies and economic incentives for new technologies in transportation.  -->
