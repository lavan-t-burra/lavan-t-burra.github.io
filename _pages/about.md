Lavan is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Aspire Research Center at the Lyles School of Civil Engineering. His research focuses on analyzing consumer purchase decisions for new-vehicle technologies and driving behavior, with an eye towards informing effective design of energy policies. He has a strong interest in multidisciplinary research, particularly regarding how environmental policies and economic incentives influence vehicle choices, travel demand, and other transportation issues.
Lavan received his MS, PhD in civil and environmental engineering from the University of Maryland, and bachelor’s in civil engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. During his doctoral studies, he also spent a year as a researcher at the RWI-Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Germany, funded by a European Commission fellowship.

I'm a recent PhD graduate in Transportation Engineering passionate about using quantitative and statistical analysis to provide evidence-based solutions. I specialize in areas like causal inference, econometric and consumer behavior modeling, predictive modeling, demand forecasting, and policy evaluation.

My work focuses primarily on electric vehicle adoption—investigating the impact of charging infrastructure, shifts in consumer demand for electric cars, and their environmental benefits—often using engineering and econometric techniques. 

I have a keen interest in multidisciplinary research, particularly in addressing questions related to the effects of environmental policies and economic incentives for new technologies in transportation.
